6/20/2012 - Several conversations with Ms. Krenzer regarding this FSE inspections at Daycares over past month. This is a six (6) week program running in the summer only for kids aged 6-13.  The operator is receiving grant funding from the United Way which requires them to be an OCFS registered Child Care Facility.  Operator was not pleased to have to renovate the kitchen at the school they will be using are using had an inadequate kitchen facility.  (The school used to have a FSE permit yet they switched to bringing lunches only. Also Encompass is a different operator than the Norman Howard School, Encompass is renting facility for the summer. ) After speaking to OCFS Ms. Krenzer understood the would not receive grant funding unless they were a registered School age Daycare facility. She agreed to install the 3rd bay w/ indirect drain as a compromise as they agreed to having fruits and vegetables pre-washed.  Separate hand washing sink also needed to be installed.  Kitchen plans submitted reflect these two sink installations.

6/22/2015 - Email from Mary Beth Kula, Director. Lackmann culinary services (Operator for Murphy Residence Dining Hall) will now be handling the preparation of the fruits and veggies we serve for snack and the washing and sanitizing of any dishes. This will eliminate the need for the three basin sink we had talked about. We are not using the mini fridge in the toddler room and have just moved to only use the fridge in the preschool and pre-k classrooms. We have moved all frozen items out of the chest freezer and are only using the freezers in the preschool and pre-k rooms. We have replaced the fridge light bulbs and all single service items are stored in covered containers. Staff food is labeled and kept on separate shelves. Thermometers will be replaced.

7/30/2015 - Operator  stated she was told by a previous inspector the 3rd sink was only for food prep which is why it's too small to sanitize dishes.  Explained the 3rd sink was installed to sanitize dishs and indirect drain was installed so it could also be used as a Food Prep sink too. Operator plans on enlarging sink so facility can sanitize dishes.  Facility has a dish washer yet commercial grade with no external temperature controls. Operator now understands a FSE must have a 3 bay sink for wash, rinse and sanitizing.  Handwashing sink is in a bathroom in the outer lobby.

6/16/17 Pro-op inspection done. Sheila said that she doesn't think she can open by 7/1 and is looking at starting on 7/10. She is having a gas meter installed on Wed 6/28/17 so there is no hot water at this time. She will call me when that is completed. Also, she had a few ceiling tiles missing and one bathroom door did not automatically close. I spoke to her about our food worker training. She seemed interested. Jrg

6/23/17 Per call from Sheila, the hot water is on and the other two violations have also been corrected.
